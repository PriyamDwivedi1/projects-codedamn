Hello there, welcome to the first step of the HTML5 SpaceX Clone Project Tutorial. In this project, you are going to build SpaceX website clone using HTML5 and CSS and little bit of js. You can find bg images in the `assets` folder. You will be using only `HTML5` and `CSS3` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project. You can view the Desktop-Design of the project in the `design` folder. It contains the screenshot of the final output in desktop and you can build the mobile design however you like. But, the desktop design should be same as the image.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

1. Start from by creating navbar. You can view image included in design folder.
2. Ensure that the website is responsive across different viewports.
3. Add a footer stating the name of the Project - SpaceX Clone Project.
4. You design mobile layout however you like.

Now that you have understood the basic requirements let's, hop on to the next step and start building the website!
