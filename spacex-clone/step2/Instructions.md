In this step you will make navbar.

## What will you do?

1. Set the display to flex of the nav tag. So, the links will be in horizontal and add `space-between` property to it.

2. Set the background of the navbar to transparent.

3. Set the `color` of nav links to white;

    ```css
    color: #fff;
    ```

4. Add a hover animation to nav-links you can use the ::after atrribute. on `anchor tags`.

5. `Poppins` should be the font-family of the navbar.

    ```css
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    ```


## For Geeks

It can seem daunting to write the HTML structure for the gallery project, well it is not. You can always make use of `emmet` to create a complex HTML structure with a single line of code.

```
article.img-container*12>img.gallery-image[src=assets/$.jpg]+span.title>lorem3
```

You can use this structure to create the same HTML Structure that we have written manually. You can learn more about `emmet` [here](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/).
